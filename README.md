# Nodejsmon Backend


Nodejsmon is the backend service for the Reactmon game, providing a robust API built with Node.js and MongoDB. This project demonstrates modern backend development practices, including containerization with Docker and environment-based configuration.

## üöÄ Features

- RESTful API for Pok√©mon game mechanics
- User authentication and authorization
- Database integration with MongoDB
- Dockerized for easy deployment and scaling

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Docker
- JWT for authentication

## üèóÔ∏è Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Fill in the `.env` file with your specific details. Here's an example:
   ```
   DB_PORT=32964
   DB_NAME=nodejsmon
   DB_HOST=mongo_nodejsmon
   APP_PORT=3006
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   FRONTEND_TEST_URL=http://localhost:5173
   MAX_POKEMON=151
   ```
4. Build and run the Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

The API should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:3006` (or whichever port you specified in `APP_PORT`).

## üåê API Endpoints
